# 3-D CCP stacking for mantle transition zone structure under the Tibet.

The discontinuities of the 410 and the 660 (D410 and D660) are velocity discontinuities at the bottom of the upper mantle. The receiver function method will provide visible phases to highlight the topography of D410 and D660. The difference in depth between the D410 and D660 (i.e., the mantle transition zone (MTZ) thickness) is correspond to mineral phase transitions and thermal process in the mantle.

Here, we will introduce the usage of the Seispy for imaging the MTZ structure.

The package include:

- `RFdepth_1D.npy`: RF data with 1-D time-to-depth conversion using `rf2depth` command.
- `ccp.cfg`: Configure file for 3-D CCP stacking. Note that following options are exclusive.
  - `peakfile`: File to the output depth of the D410 and D660.
  - `[spacedbins]`: Options for spaced grid of bins.
- `ps_mtz.sh`: Plot map for topography of D410 and D660 and the MTZ thickness.
- `ps_profile.sh`: Plot section with 2-D CCP stacking along a profile.
  
## 3-D CCP stacking

Seispy provide a command as the `ccp3d` for the 3-D CCP stacking. Before using this command, we will introduce rules of spaced grid. 

The section `[spacedbins]` and option  `slide_val` in the `ccp.cfg` controls positions of bins. The `center_lat` and the `center_lon` are the latitude and longitude of the center of study region; `half_len_lat` and `half_len_lon` represent half length **in degree** of grid region along the latitude and longitude direction, respectively; `slide_val` represent spacing of grid **in kilometer**

> The option `slide_val` are shared by the two commands `ccp_profile` and `ccp3d`, so the unit is unified as kilometer.

In this step, there is compensation for curvature to avoid distortion at high latitude.
